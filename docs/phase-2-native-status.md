# Phase 2 Native Coverage Status

This status note records independently verified Phase 2 native vertical
slices. Generated corpora, validator output, and comparison files remain
ignored and uncommitted. A registry row is promoted from `planned` only after
its generator, manifest contract, internal validation, coverage reports,
focused tests, determinism check, and independent conformance checks agree.

## Geometry and series milestone

### Non-uniform CT slice spacing

`geometry/ct/nonuniform_slice_spacing` is an implemented `core` case containing
three axial CT instances at Image Position (Patient) Z coordinates 0, 4, and
10 mm. The adjacent intervals are therefore 4 and 6 mm. Instance Numbers 1,
2, and 3 agree with geometric order, so the case isolates unequal physical
spacing from sorting conflict.

The instances deliberately omit optional Spacing Between Slices `(0018,0088)`.
The manifest instead records every Image Position (Patient) and Image
Orientation (Patient) vector, the complete adjacent-spacing vector, geometric
rank, Instance Number state and rank, and `spacing_uniform: false`. Internal
validation reopens the files and derives these values from the serialized
objects. JSON and Markdown reports expose the same expectations.

## Verification evidence

The following checks passed on 2026-08-26 for a seed-23 `core` corpus:

- focused registry, generation, manifest-schema, geometry-validation,
  coverage-report, gap-report, and recipe-inventory tests;
- two independent generation runs with byte-identical DICOM files and
  manifests;
- internal validation of all 27 generated `core` instances with zero
  failures;
- locked `dciodvfy` SHA-256
  `1aeb75d6ccd3f193e3b322b6da77742cdce2e0604868eaf2a2669c786cbc27e5`;
- `dciodvfy -new` on all three non-uniform CT instances with no findings;
- locked `dcentvfy` SHA-256
  `1b96e598f28f66deee1bfc1cb52ff460c316ab6b0625dae575d701f20c836e2c`;
- `dcentvfy` on the three-instance series with no findings;
- locked DCMTK `dcmdump` SHA-256
  `d2261944ea1ceb6743df9866f2237014b284fa39119c8a5eee226ae922ead45f`;
  and
- independent DCMTK extraction of positions 0, 4, and 10, axial orientation,
  Instance Numbers 1, 2, and 3, and absence of Spacing Between Slices.

The two matching `core` corpora each occupy 480 KiB in the local filesystem.
This measurement is implementation-environment evidence rather than a
portable byte-size guarantee; tracked generated artifacts remain forbidden.

## Remaining work

The geometry and series milestone still requires gantry tilt, duplicate and
empty Type 2 Instance Number values, shared Frame of Reference across multiple
series in one study, and its milestone-level regression and conformance run.
The existing enhanced MR temporal case supplies the planned temporal/dynamic
coverage and will be included in that final milestone audit.
