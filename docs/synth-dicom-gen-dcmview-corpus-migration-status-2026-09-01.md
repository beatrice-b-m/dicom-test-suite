# `synth-dicom-gen` / `dcmview-test-corpus` migration status

**Recorded:** 2026-09-01

**Updated:** 2026-09-01

**Contract:** `docs/synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-corpus-separation-plan.md`

**Starting repository:** `dicom-test-suite`

**Exact starting revision:**
`fbd0f76a36dc5726bb41602f44bff290588f560d`

**Starting worktree state:** clean (`git status --short` produced no output)

## Status contract

This is the current dated execution record for phases R0-R9. The separation
plan's ordering, acceptance gates, verification classes, evidence boundaries,
and completion definition are authoritative. This record distinguishes
implemented behavior and executed evidence from proposed work. A row is
complete only when its acceptance condition has passed at the recorded commit;
an unrun command, unavailable target, missing runtime, or planned repository is
never an implied pass.

The immutable `dicom-test-suite 0.1.0` release-candidate evidence at
`69d3e5f8e045752b6e183781a7e13190a61430ff` remains historical evidence for
that exact candidate only. It is not inherited by a renamed product, moved
corpus, changed schema, changed identity domain, new repository, or new release
artifact.

## Current gate state

| Phase | State | Completed items | Current evidence or next gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R0 — freeze migration contract | In progress | R0.1, R0.2, R0.3 | ADR 0003 fixes the separation contract. The dated cost baseline records current development cost, and the exhaustive 801-path ownership inventory assigns every baseline/task file one disposition, destination, domain, invalidated verification class, and migration slice. R0.4 remains unimplemented, so the R0 gate has not passed. |
| R1 — contain CI and local build cost | Not started | None | Requires the accepted R0 contract and dated baseline. |
| R2 — reduce Rust test-linking amplification | Not started | None | Requires R1 routing and the R0 test-target baseline. |
| R3 — rename reusable product | Not started | None | Requires the R0 gate; no current file, package, crate, binary, archive, or environment spelling has been migrated. |
| R4 — split immutable resources and corpus definitions | Not started | None | Requires the accepted naming decision and sequential resource/schema migration. |
| R5 — add supported external corpus API | Not started | None | Requires the R4 resource and identity boundary. |
| R6 — establish smoke corpus repository | Not started | None | No external repository has been created; authority and destination are still required before out-of-workspace mutation. |
| R7 — migrate complete dcmview corpus | Not started | None | Requires R6 smoke parity and supported contracts. |
| R8 — decouple viewer development | Not started | None | Requires a qualified artifact key and complete-enough corpus ownership. |
| R9 — remove embedded corpus and qualify products | Not started | None | Terminal removal, documentation, measurement, and exact qualification have not run. |

## Completed phase-item evidence

### R0.1 — superseding boundary ADR

**State:** complete

**Commit:** the commit introducing this record, with subject
`docs(migration): freeze repository separation contract` (resolve the exact
object with `git log --format='%H %s' -- docs/adr/0003-synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-corpus-separation.md`)

**Owned files:**

- `docs/adr/0003-synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-corpus-separation.md`
- `docs/synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-corpus-migration-status-2026-09-01.md`

**Decision evidence:** ADR 0003 supersedes only the repository-boundary
assumptions of ADR 0002 and the completed standalone plan. It fixes
`synth-dicom-gen` as repository/product/package/crate distribution and binary,
`synth_dicom_gen` as the Rust path, and `dcmview-test-corpus` as the downstream
repository. It classifies crate, library, executable, schema, resource,
manifest, and recipe/template changes under the current compatibility policy;
sets the first renamed product release to `0.2.0`; and records ownership,
dependency, identity, evidence, verification-class, and non-goal boundaries.

**Inputs reviewed:**

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
- `docs/synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-corpus-separation-plan.md`
- `docs/standalone-productization-plan.md`
- `docs/adr/0002-standalone-product-boundary.md`
- `docs/compatibility-policy.md`
- `docs/standalone-product-status-2026-08-31.md`
- `docs/rust-api-compatibility-audit-2026-08-31.md`
- `docs/product-resource-lookup-audit-2026-08-31.md`

**Verification:** documentation-only Fast PR checks passed:

```text
cargo test --locked --no-default-features --test standalone_docs
result: 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
elapsed: 38.38 seconds

git diff --check --cached
result: passed with no output
```

The focused test preserves the installed-product guide, documentation-map,
neutral-example, and README external-consumer contracts while the new ADR
supersedes only repository ownership. No generator, corpus, package, release,
or target qualification is claimed by R0.1.

### R0.2 — dated development-cost baseline

**State:** complete

**Baseline revision:**
`65a296bbb489fcaaff22e38fa35036f0805ccab6`, code-equivalent to starting
revision `fbd0f76a36dc5726bb41602f44bff290588f560d` outside R0.1 documentation.

**Evidence:**
`docs/synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-cost-baseline-2026-09-01.md`

The baseline maps every current workflow job and recorded heavyweight target
to an owner, verification class, and R1/R2 acceptance item. A clean explicit
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` all-target no-run build completed in 72.29 seconds, occupied
8,013,463,552 bytes, and linked 188 Cargo-reported harness artifacts, including
186 integration-test targets. The exact temporary target and log paths were
removed after measurement.

Public GitHub API data for authoritative run `33491521696` records 7,935
seconds (132m15s) of wall time through the isolated successful retry, 10,545
seconds (175m45s) of actual runner time including the failed JPEG 2000 attempt,
and 180 per-job rounded billable minutes. The run uploaded one 9,929,745-byte
artifact, ID `9798112659`, whose archive and ZIP identities remain bound to
historical candidate `69d3e5f8`. The run predates `f1d1727`'s removal of an
unrelated curated test from codec jobs, so its exact codec timings are
conservative historical evidence rather than a claim of a remote run at
`65a296b`.

No independent Fast PR, Corpus PR, Nightly, or release-candidate workflow is
present at R0.2. Subsystem and corpus-edit costs are not independently
measurable because every push, pull request, and manual dispatch selects the
same graph with no concurrency cancellation or path routing. No heavyweight
qualification or durable generation was performed for this baseline.

**Verification:** the documentation-only Fast PR check
`cargo test --locked --no-default-features --test standalone_docs` passed 4/4
tests in 0.20 seconds, and `git diff --check` passed with no output. This does
not qualify any generator, corpus, codec, provider, package, release, or target.

### R0.3 — exhaustive file/module ownership inventory

**State:** complete

**Baseline revision:**
`f640748b412151b4410dfb104685519cef2bde75`

**Evidence:**

- `docs/synth-dicom-gen-dcmview-file-ownership-2026-09-01.md`
- `product/migration-file-ownership-2026-09-01.json`

The machine-readable inventory explicitly enumerates all 799 paths tracked at
the exact baseline plus the two new R0.3 ownership artifacts. This status file
is the third task-owned file but already existed at the baseline, so it appears
exactly once. All 801 unique entries have one disposition, primary destination,
ownership domain, rationale, invalidated verification class, and migration
phase/slice. All 175 split entries additionally name concrete synth and corpus
outputs while preserving one primary disposition and destination.

Disposition totals are 283 `retain_synth`, 310 `move_corpus`, 175 `split`, zero
`retire`, and 33 `archive_history`. The zero retirement count is intentional:
embedded-corpus code is split or moved until supported replacements and parity
make deletion safe. Domain totals are 105 engine, 136 generic capability, 313
corpus definition, 20 viewer expectations, 33 historical evidence, 20
build/release, 26 documentation, 4 governance/legal, and 144 test
infrastructure paths.

The inventory distinguishes corpus registry/recipes and case-selection notes
from generic templates/providers/engine evidence; assigns viewer schemas and
expectations downstream; and preserves dated documents, hashes, old artifact
names, ADRs, and qualification claims as synth history. Ambiguous-looking
`CorpusPlan`, manifest/schema, recipe-family, conformance-adapter, lockfile, and
mixed-test decisions are resolved in the dated evidence document.

**Verification:** a deterministic Python comparison proved the inventory path
set equals both `git ls-files` at the R0.3 commit and the fixed baseline tree
plus the two new paths, with no duplicates, missing paths, or extras. The same
check validated required fields, enums, destination prefixes, split-output
shape, and non-empty values. `jq empty`, `git diff --check`, and the focused
documentation test passed. Exact command results are recorded in the R0.3
commit and task report. No generation, parity, package, release, external
repository, target, or R0-gate qualification is claimed.

## Measurements

| Measurement | Baseline command/revision | R0 value | Terminal value | State |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CI wall time by verification class | Run `33491521696`; class projection documented in the dated baseline | 132m15s full observed interval; no class is independently routed | — | Baseline recorded |
| Billable runner time by verification class | Exact API job durations; failed attempt plus retry included | 175m45s actual; 180 per-job rounded minutes | — | Baseline recorded |
| Largest local target-directory size | `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/private/tmp/dts-r02-target.xAApSK cargo test --locked --all-targets --no-default-features --no-run` | 8,013,463,552 bytes after 72.29s | — | Baseline recorded; exact directory removed |
| Integration-test target count | Cargo metadata plus top-level `tests/*.rs` at `65a296b` | 186 integration targets; 188 Cargo-reported harness executables | — | Baseline recorded |
| CI/generated artifact count and size | Actions API for run `33491521696` | 1 upload, ID `9798112659`, 9,929,745-byte ZIP; no uploaded corpus | — | Baseline recorded |
| Representative generator Fast PR | No independent class at `65a296b` | Not independently measurable; every PR selects the full graph | — | Explicit boundary recorded |
| Representative corpus PR | Repository does not yet exist; embedded corpus edit selects full graph | Not independently measurable | — | Explicit boundary recorded |
| Representative viewer PR | Viewer repository not in current scope | — | — | Not measured |
| Nightly and release-candidate cost | No separate Nightly/RC trigger; run `33491521696` is exact candidate evidence | Nightly not independently measurable; provider/default/release critical chain 123m53s | — | Explicit boundary recorded |

Before/after cost reduction cannot be claimed until R1/R2 record comparable
class-specific results and R9.6 repeats the terminal measurements. The R0.2
baseline is diagnostic evidence, not proof that a target budget has passed.

## Blockers and authority boundaries

- R0.4 remains required before the R0 gate can pass.
- The location, remote, and creation authority for `dcmview-test-corpus` have
  not been supplied. No external repository, remote, release, or other out-of-
  workspace state has been created or mutated.
- External-consumer inventory has not run. The clean rename remains the
  default; a temporary alias may be introduced only if R3.2 discovers a real
  consumer and records its tested support window.
- No generator or corpus release target is currently qualified under the new
  names. Existing macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64 evidence remains scoped to the
  immutable historical candidate named above.

## Terminal acceptance matrix

| Gate | State | Required terminal evidence or current blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository boundary | Not run | Must prove no generator dependency on dcmview and no corpus use of unsupported modules or sibling paths. |
| Naming and compatibility | Not run | Current product still uses `dicom-test-suite`; renamed package, library, binary, archives, discovery, guides, and migrations do not exist. |
| External corpus contract | Not run | Versioned external definition loader and CLI/SDK generation contract are not implemented. |
| Identity separation | Not run | Engine, toolchain, template/provider, schema, corpus, and external-runtime identities are not independently projected. |
| Smoke migration | Not run | R0 parity baseline and R6 repository smoke generation have not run. |
| Complete migration | Not run | The current repository still owns the complete embedded corpus. |
| Fast development | Not run | R0 measurements and representative post-change PR measurements are absent. |
| Heavy qualification | Not run | New nightly/manual/release routing and exact applicable runs are absent. |
| Artifact consumption | Not run | No keyed downstream corpus artifact or default viewer-consumption workflow exists. |
| Packaging and release | Not run | Neither renamed repository has an independently qualified release procedure or exact candidate record. |
| Documentation | Not run | ADR 0003 records the intended boundary; current operating documents still describe the monolithic product. |
| Hygiene | Not run | Terminal clean-worktree, formatting, schema, diff, artifact, secret, and package-inventory checks have not run in both repositories. |

The migration is not complete until every R0-R9 gate and every row above
passes, both repositories are clean and independently usable, measured cost
reductions are recorded, and exact qualification evidence exists for every
claimed target and scope.
